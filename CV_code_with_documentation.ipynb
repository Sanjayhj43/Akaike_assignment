    "# Problem Statement:\n",
    "The problem statement is to develop a solution using image processing techniques to partially de-annotate an image, given an original image and a fully annotated image. The solution should remove specific annotations from the fully annotated image while preserving the underlying information of the original image.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Potential Application of the Problem Statement:\n",
    "This problem statement has various potential applications, including but not limited to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Privacy Protection: Removing sensitive or private information from images while keeping the rest of the content intact.\n",
    "2. Data Augmentation: Generating training data for object detection models by partially de-annotating existing annotated images.\n",
    "3. Content Modification: Making modifications to images without altering the entire content, for example, for artistic purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Type of  Problem:\n",
    "This problem is primarily an image processing task. It involves techniques for image enhancement, segmentation, and merging.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data:\n",
    "The data required for this task includes:\n",
    "1. Original images: The images you want to partially de-annotate.\n",
    "2. Fully annotated images: Images with all annotations, including those that need to be removed.\n",
    "3. Partially annotated images (for evaluation): These are used for evaluation purposes, to compare the output of your solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Problems with Data and How You Have Solved Them:\n",
    "1. Data Quality: Ensuring that the original and fully annotated images are of the same size and that the annotations align correctly.\n",
    "   - Solution: The code resizes the fully annotated image to match the size of the original image. It ensures alignment by separating the annotated part.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data Variability: Handling different types of images and annotations.\n",
    "   - Solution: The code is designed to handle various image types and annotations by calculating the rate of foreground (ROF) to determine which half of the fully annotated image should be kept.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Stepwise Solution (Flowchart):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the original image and fully annotated image.\n",
    "   - Convert both images to arrays for manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Enhance the fully annotated image for better processing.\n",
    "   - Convert the image to grayscale.\n",
    "   - Apply histogram equalization to enhance contrast.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Calculate the rate of foreground (ROF) in the fully annotated image.\n",
    "   - ROF = (number of foreground pixels) / (total number of pixels).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Determine which half of the fully annotated image to keep based on ROF.\n",
    "   - If ROF <= 0.5, keep the left half.\n",
    "   - If ROF > 0.5, keep the right half.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Copy the selected half (annotated part) to the original image.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Save the output image, which is partially de-annotated.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Final Solution:\n",
    "The final solution involves taking an original image and a fully annotated image, enhancing the fully annotated image, calculating the ROF to decide which half to keep, and merging it with the original image. The result is a partially de-annotated image with annotations removed from one half while preserving the original image's content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please make sure to provide the correct file paths for the original and fully annotated images and specify the output path for the partially de-annotated image before running the code."

    "# let's break down my code step by step to understand its functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import Libraries:\n",
    "   - The code starts by importing the necessary libraries, including OpenCV (cv2) and NumPy for image processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Define the `enhance_image` Function:\n",
    "   - This function is responsible for enhancing the fully annotated image to improve the quality of the annotations.\n",
    "   - It converts the input image to grayscale and then applies Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) to enhance the contrast.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Define the `get_output_image` Function:\n",
    "   - This function is the core of the code and performs the partial de-annotation of the image.\n",
    "   - It takes three parameters: `original_image_path`, `fully_annotated_image_path`, and `output_image_path`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Load the Original and Fully Annotated Images:\n",
    "   - Inside the `get_output_image` function, it loads the original and fully annotated images using `cv2.imread`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Print Image Shapes:\n",
    "   - It prints the shapes of the original and fully annotated images to verify that they have the same dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Resize the Fully Annotated Image:\n",
    "   - The fully annotated image is resized to match the dimensions of the original image using `cv2.resize`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Convert Images to Arrays:\n",
    "   - Both the original and fully annotated images are converted to multidimensional NumPy arrays to facilitate further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Separating the Annotated Regions:\n",
    "   - The fully annotated image is split into two halves, the left half and the right half. This separation assumes that the annotations are on one side, and the other side contains the original content.\n",
    "   - The separation is done by slicing the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Calculate the Rate of Foreground (ROF):\n",
    "   - The code calculates the Rate of Foreground (ROF) for the fully annotated image. ROF is the ratio of the number of foreground (annotated) pixels to the total number of pixels in the image.\n",
    "   - This ratio is calculated by counting the non-zero (annotated) pixels in the fully annotated image and dividing it by the total number of pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Determine Which Half to Keep:\n",
    "   - Based on the calculated ROF, the code decides which half of the fully annotated image to keep.\n",
    "   - If ROF is less than or equal to 0.5, it keeps the left half. Otherwise, it keeps the right half.\n",
    "   - This step determines which annotations to remove.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Copy the Annotated Region:\n",
    "   - The code copies the annotated part (either the left or right half) to the original image. This effectively removes the unwanted annotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Save the Output Image:\n",
    "   - The modified original image, with the annotations removed, is saved as the output image.\n",
    "   - It converts the image to RGB format using `cv2.cvtColor` and then saves it with `cv2.imwrite`.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Specify File Paths:\n",
    "   - Before the code can be executed, you need to specify the file paths for the original image, fully annotated image, and the output image path.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, my code loads two images (original and fully annotated), calculates the Rate of Foreground (ROF), determines which half of the fully annotated image to keep based on ROF, and then merges it with the original image. The result is a partially de-annotated image with the annotations removed from one side."
